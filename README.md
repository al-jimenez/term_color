# term_color()
This is a simple function that displays a chart of colors and/or will display a color given a number.

## Use
Use this and customize it with your changes. I use this as a menu of colors since my old man brain cannot remember the color number for a specific color.

## OS
Used / created for macOS bash but can be modified for other OS.

## Help menu
When you execute term_color -? you will get the following:
![Help menu](https://github.com/al-jimenez/term_color/blob/master/term_color_help.png)

## With no options
![without options](https://github.com/al-jimenez/term_color/blob/master/term_colors.png)

## Usage Examples

 term_color -?  -  to get the help menu

 term_color 34 = will return the color for 34 (green lime backgrown with white foreground)

## TBD FUTURE FIX
  To accept the hexidecimal number as input rather then the integer
